            <h2 class="center-text">Development Methdology</h2>
            <p>
                The Adirontech team will use an Agile development methodology, with development sprints completing feature requirements taking the form of user stories. An Agile methodology is preferable for this system because it prevents certain elements from being blocked from completion due to reliance on other incomplete requirements. Our team will also benefit from asynchronous standups and sprint retrospectives, allowing us to keep tabs on our progress and regularly check-in with each other to be more aware of how we are progressing. Development progress will be kept track of using a Trello board, with user stories and features being delegated each sprint depending on the workload we are taking on at that time. Testing will be handled by Github’s automatic build tests, running a testing suite on new builds before they are accepted to be merged to ensure things remain working as expected.
            </p>

            <h2 class="center-text">Metrics</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to measuring our individual project-related efforts and team efforts, we also plan to utilize <b>requirements volatility</b> for our product metric, and <b>code review completion time</b> for our process metric. We believe that tracking requirements volatility will be beneficial due to the novelty of this project and the potential increase in scope. Additionally, we believe that tracking code review completion time will be beneficial due to the Agile framework in which our team will be operating. Given that we will work in two week sprints, it is important for us to manage code reviews and complete reviews as quickly as possible.

            <h2 class="center-text">Domain Model</h2>
            <img class="img-border" src="./assets/img/domain_model.jpeg" alt="Domain model diagram" width="800">
            <p>
                The domain model above captures important entities in the Adirondack Visitor Use Management system. First, hikers pre-register their intended hikes using the web app. Once the hiker is at the trail for their hike, the hiker will check in using the kiosk at the trailhead. The web app and trailhead kiosk will synchronize data so that hikers can view all of their updated information. 	
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important entity in the domain model is the Adirondack Park ranger. The ranger is responsible for monitoring trails, as well as retrieving data from remote kiosks throughout the park. Remote kiosks are located at various trails throughout the park. Additionally, remote kiosks do not have access to WiFi, so the kiosk will ping hikers’ devices via bluetooth in order to count the number of visitors passing by the remote kiosk. Due to the lack of WiFi access, rangers need to retrieve data from the remote kiosks in order to upload the data to the Adirondack Visitor Use Management system. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="center-text">Scope Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The Adirondack Visitor Use Management system will implement a three-part solution to the challenges of paper trail logs, with the goal of eventually replacing paper trail logs entirely. The first part of the solution, the trailhead kiosk, will allow hikers to check-in and check-out from hikes. The second part of the solution, the remote kiosk, will count the number of visitors that pass by using a Bluetooth pinging system. Lastly, the third part of the solution, the app, will allow hikers to pre-register their hikes, view important information about trails, and view parking availability. Additionally, the app will allow park rangers to view aggregated data regarding trail usage. The app is not intended to be used during a hike, but rather to assist hikers with planning their hike. In addition, the app is not intended to be used for emergency situations, due to the lack of reliable WiFi connection.

            <p>
                In addition to action submissions, such as the midterm project review, short video, and final project presentation, our project will have several major deliverables. The first deliverable is the Web App, which we expect to complete by the beginning of November. The second deliverable is the Trailhead Kiosk, which we expect to complete by the beginning of December. The third and final deliverable is the Remote Kiosk, which we expect to complete by the end of December. Once these three deliverables are completed, we will implement any stretch goals and additional features that could improve the system.
