                The Adirondack Wilderness Advocates is a non-profit organization 
                committed to the betterment and enjoyment of the Adirondack Park. 
                For many years, trail usage at the Adirondack Park has been 
                managed via paper trail logs. However, due to a recent increase 
                in trail usage and difficulty in aggregating information from 
                numerous paper trail logs around the Adirondack Park, 
                there is an opportunity to improve the trail usage management system. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The goal of this project is to address the challenges of paper trail logs 
                and promote sustainable growth by implementing a digital trail log system. 
                The digital trail log system will consist of a trailhead kiosk, 
                a remote kiosk, and a web app. The trailhead kiosk, which will be connected 
                to a power source and have WiFi access, will replace the existing paper trail log. 
                Hikers will be able to check-in and check-out via the trailhead kiosk. 
                The remote kiosk, which may be connected to a power source but will not 
                have WiFi access due to the nature of the Adirondack Park, 
                will collect trail usage information via a bluetooth pinging system. 
                Lastly, the web app will allow hikers to pre-register their trip and 
                view relative information about every trail, such as typical 
                weather conditions, difficulty, and length. The app will also allow 
                park rangers to view aggregated trail usage statistics. 
                Together, these three tools will enable the Adirondack Park community to 
                safely manage trail usage and better enjoy the park experience.
